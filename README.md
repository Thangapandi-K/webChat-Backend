# webChat -  Backend

- An web application to send & receive realtime messages to friends connected using Email Ids.

- As a personal project i build this to practice clean code, follow best practices, to learn real world concepts and implement them in this project.

- Will continue building this project to implement new concepts that i come across and also to practice refactoring existing code to new version.
